>Infrared and visible image fusion aims to generate a fused image by integrating and distinguishing complementary information from multiple sources. While the cross-attention mechanism with global spatial interactions appears promising, it only capture second-order spatial interactions, neglecting higher-order interactions in both spatial and channel dimensions. This limitation hampers the exploitation of synergies between multi-modalities. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Synergistic High-order Interaction Paradigm (SHIP), designed to systematically investigate the spatial fine-grained and global statistics collaborations between infrared and visible images across two fundamental dimensions: 1) Spatial dimension: we construct spatial fine-grained interactions through element-wise multiplication, mathematically equivalent to global interactions, and then foster high-order formats by iteratively aggregating and evolving complementary information, enhancing both efficiency and flexibility; 2) Channel dimension: expanding on channel interactions with first-order statistics (mean), we devise high-order channel interactions to facilitate the discernment of inter-dependencies between source images based on global statistics. Harnessing high-order interactions significantly enhances our model's ability to exploit multi-modal synergies, leading to superior performance over state-of-the-art alternatives, as shown through comprehensive experiments across various benchmarks.

## ðŸš€: How to test

1. Update the paths of image sets and pre-trained models.
 ```
Updating the paths in configure files of /SHIP/options/test/highOrderInteractionFusion.yml
```

2. Run the testing commands.
 ```
python test.py -opt /SHIP/options/test/highOrderInteractionFusion.yml
```

## ðŸš€: How to train

1. Download saliency maps on the M3FD dataset from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CIsMmt6XZH4UMjca4K1DhLew_xNGrXv0?usp=drive_link) or run VSM.m to generate maps for your own data.

2. Update the paths of image sets in the training configuration.
 ```
Updating the paths in configure files of /SHIP/options/train/highOrderInteractionFusion.yml
```

3. Run the training commands.
 ```
python train.py -opt /SHIP/options/train/highOrderInteractionFusion.yml
```
